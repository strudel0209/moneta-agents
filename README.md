Moneta is an AI-powered assistant designed to empower insurance and banking advisors. This Solution Accelerator provides a chat interface where advisors can interact with various AI agents specialized in different domains such as insurance policies, CRM, product information, funds, CIO insights, and news.

You can choose chich Agentic orchestration framework the Solution uses behind the scene by setting the approriate env variable. Choose from: 
* [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) 
* [Microsoft GBB AI EMEA - Vanilla Agents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/vanilla-aiagents) 

## Prerequisites

* Docker
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
* python 3.12
* pip

## Features

- Agentic framework selection Support: Switch between Semantic Kernel and experimental MSFT GBB Vanilla Agents
- Multi-Use Case Support: Switch between insurance and banking use cases
- Agent Collaboration: Agents collaborate to provide the best answers
- Azure AD Authentication: Secure login with Microsoft Azure Active Directory
- Conversation History: Access and continue previous conversations

## Implementation Details
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Streamlit (frontend app - chatGPT style)
- Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL - if using authentication - optional)
- Azure AD application registration (if using authentication - optional)
- An Azure Container App hosting backend API endpoint
- CosmosDB to store user conversations and history

## Use Cases

### Insurance (SK)

- `CRM`: simulate fetching clients information from a CRM (DB, third-party API etc)
- `Policies RAG`: vector search with AI Search on various public available policy documents (product information)
- `Responder`: collects previous agents replies and respond to the user

### Banking (SK)

- `CRM`: simulate fetching clients information from a CRM (DB, third-party API etc)
- `Funds and ETF RAG`: vector search with AI Search on few funds and ETF factsheets (product information)
- `CIO`: vector search with AI Search on in-house investments view and recommendations
- `News`: RSS online feed search on stock news
- `Responder`: collects previous agents replies and respond to the user

Note: GBB Vanilla agents are similar but differs a bit (no responder agent)

### Azure deployment (automated)

To configure, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you AZ CLI is logged in in the right tenant. Optionally:

    ```shell
    az login --tenant your_tenant.onmicrosoft.com
    ```

1. Create a new azd environment:

    ```shell
    azd env new
    ```

    This will create a folder under `.azure/` in your project to store the configuration for this deployment. You may have multiple azd environments if desired.

1. Set the `AZURE_AUTH_TENANT_ID` azd environment variable to the tenant ID you want to use for Entra authentication:

    ```shell
    azd env set AZURE_AUTH_TENANT_ID $(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)
    ```

1. Login to the azd CLI with the Entra tenant ID:

    ```shell
    azd auth login --tenant-id $(azd env get-value AZURE_AUTH_TENANT_ID)
    ```

1. Proceed with AZD deployment:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```
### Deployment Scripts explaination (files in `scripts/`)
This project includes preprovision, postprovision, and postdeploy scripts for both Bash and PowerShell environments that works with the Azure Developer CLI (azd) on Windows, macOS, and Linux:
- **preprovision** scripts set up Azure resources (App Registrations, environment variables).
- **postprovision** scripts configure additional settings (redirect URIs, secrets).
- **postdeploy** scripts handle data loading (AI Search, Cosmos DB).
- **predown** scripts deletes an Azure app registration using the provided Azure App Registration ID before executing the resource purge.

### Data indexing 

Demo data is loaded with the `azd up` process automatically.

Indexes are sourced from 'src/data/ai-search-index' folder.
Each subfolder of the data folder will be a seperate index. 

Customer profiles are sourced from 'src/data/customer-profiles'.
Each subfolder of the data folder will be get a seperate index. 

AZD deploy process will run `setup_aisearch.py` and `setup_cosmosdb.py`. 
DO NOT run those commands by hand unless you are confident you understand how the environment needs to be setup. 

In case you need to reload the data, you can do it by running:
```shell
azd hooks run postdeploy
```

**OBS!** If you deploy from WSL mounted path, the postdeploy data init might fail. Please consider rerunning from WSL native path location.


### Running the App locally - BACKEND

The python project is managed by `pyproject.toml` and the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
Install uv prior executing.

To run locally:

Mind the `sample.env` file - by default the application will try to read AZD environment variables and falls back on `.env` only when it does not find one.

Activate the `.venv` virtual environment or run the binary directly:

```shell
cd src/backend
uv sync
./.venv/bin/uvicorn app:app 
```

### Running the App locally - FRONTEND

The python project is managed by pyproject.toml and [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
Install uv prior executing.

To run locally:

mind the sample.env file - by default the application will try to read AZD enviornment configuraiton and falls on .env only when it does not find one.

**OBS!** Activate .venv or run the binary directly.

```shell
cd src/frontend
uv sync
./.venv/bin/streamlit run app.py
```

### Usage

1. **Select Use Case**: Choose between `fsi_insurance` and `fsi_banking` from the sidebar
2. **Start a Conversation**: Click "Start New Conversation" or select an existing one
3. **Chat**: Use the chat input to ask questions. Predefined questions are available in a dropdown
