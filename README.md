### Data indexing 
You can index your data located under the data folder by executing first the data_upload.py and then data_index.py.
Each subfolder of the data folder will be a seperate index. 
If you are using managed identity make sure to assign the following roles to the AI Search: Cognitive Service OpenAI user, Storage Blob Data Reader.
Assign the following roles to the user (yourself): Cognitive Service OpenAI user, Storage Blob Data Contributor, Search Service Data Contributor and Search Service Contributor. 

### Docker deployment (local) - backend

- create a .env file following the backend/.env.sample
- adjust your docker container names / registries in backend/deploy_backend_acr.sh 
- chmod u+x backend/deploy_backend_acr.sh 
-./backend/deploy_backend_acr.sh  

### Docker deployment (local) - frontend

- create a .env file following the env.sample in the project frontend directory and set the following environment variables: 

Mandatory variables (use `DISABLE_LOGIN=True` for local dev and to bypass MSAL auth):
```
DISABLE_LOGIN=<Set to `True` to disable login>
FUNCTION_APP_URL=<Your Azure Function App URL>
```

For enabling auth you need to have an app registration:
```
AZ_REG_APP_CLIENT_ID=<Your Azure Registered App Client ID>
AZ_TENANT_ID=<Your Azure Tenant ID>
WEB_REDIRECT_URI=<Your Redirect URI>
```

- adjust your docker container names / registries in frontend/deploy_frontend_acr.sh 
- chmod u+x frontend/deploy_frontend_acr.sh 
-./frontend/deploy_frontend_acr.sh 

### Authorizing CosmosDB DB Role to your principal (local deployment)
- get your MSFT principalId (from entra) 
- modify the backend/cosmosdb_cli_role.sh with your principalId and cosmosdb account and resource group
- run the shell script
